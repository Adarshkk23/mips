# MIPS pipline
A classic 5-stage pipeline MIPS 32-bit processor.

five stages of a microprocessor: instruction fetch (IF),
instruction decode (ID), execution(EX),
memory access and write (MEM) e write back (WB).


support most of MIPS instruction and solve every hazard with stall.(Data Hazards and Control Hazards) Verilog code.

# Modular design
code start from mypip

other modular named same to original model
